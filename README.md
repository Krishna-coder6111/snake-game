# Grade 11 Snake Game Project: Improved with College Concepts
## Overview
<br />This repository contains the original Snake game project created in Grade 11 and an improved version of the same game, incorporating college-level programming concepts. 
<br />The game is implemented in Python using the Pygame library.
<br />
<br />Looking back at the original project, it seemed quite challenging at the time, requiring significant debugging effort to get it working. However, as a CS major, 300 lines of code now seem quite manageable. This README covers both the old and improved versions of the game.

# Old Snake Game
## Overview
<br />This is a simple Snake game implementation in Python using the Pygame library. The game includes basic features like a start menu, pause functionality, and a restart option.

## How to Run
- Install Python 3.x on your system.
- Install the Pygame library by running pip install pygame.
- Download or clone the repository.
- Run the snake_game.py script to start the game.

## Features
- Start menu
- Pause functionality
- Restart option
- Simple collision detection
- Score tracking
# New Improved Snake Game
## Overview
<br />This is an improved version of the Snake game implemented in Python using the Pygame library. The game has been refactored and optimized to follow best practices and college-level programming concepts.

## How to Run
- Install Python 3.x on your system.
- Install the Pygame library by running pip install pygame.
- Download or clone the repository.
- Run the improved_snake_game.py script to start the game.
## Improvements
- Encapsulation of game logic into classes
- More efficient collision detection
- Use of constants and configuration files
- Consistent formatting and naming conventions
- Added comments and documentation
##Features
- Start menu
- Pause functionality
